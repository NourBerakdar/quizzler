# Quizzler question

This is a quiz app that tests your general knowledge by using questions and (true-false) choices.

## In this application I made:
* separate classes.
* Dart classes and objects.
* class constructors.
* Extracting Widgets to refactor your code.
* private and public modifiers in Dart.
